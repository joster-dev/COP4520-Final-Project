Go is an exceedingly difficult game for an artificial intelligence to conquer; this is because generating a game tree is difficult, the branching factor is too large for most systems to handle. By splitting the work of generating a game tree, that spans all potential moves available at a particular moment in the game, among all the processors available to the system, we reduce the amount of time waiting for a move to occur. The two algorithms explored in our project indicate. . .
